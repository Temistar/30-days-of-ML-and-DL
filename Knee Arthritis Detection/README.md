## Overview

This notebook represents the application of Deep Learning for detecting the level of knee arthritis by a provided X-ray.

## Dataset

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hafiznouman786/annotated-dataset-for-knee-arthritis-detection) used in this notebook is assumed to be pre-split into the 5 categories (Normal, Doubtful, Mild, Moderate, Severe).
## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Installation

To set up your environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akhundMurad/KneeArthritisDetection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd KneeArthritisDetection
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open `KneeArthritisDetection.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment.

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to execute each cell. Make sure to run the cells to avoid any errors.

## Results

The notebook will output various results including data visualizations, model performance metrics, and predictions. Make sure to review the results section to understand the effectiveness of the model.

**As a result of the experiment, I tuned the model to increase validation accuracy from 35% to 82%.**
